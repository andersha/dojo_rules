My name is Anders H.Abrahamsen and I am a senior developer situated in Bergen, Norway. I have worked with Git for 4 years and found that it was time to go through some courses to make sure I know about every little detail that I might have missed during daily use.

My favorite Code School path so far is the Javascript path. Lots of nice stuff to learn there!

Deadly Skills: 

  * Java 
  * SQL
